# Neo Time Overlay

An old *Java* based application, bult during my early years of Java development.

My pet project, that has many flaws, bugs and a lot of... let's call it... *potential*.

Nontheless, I am happy to archive it via GitHub and retrace my roots.

# How to use

Run it and it stays on top of your other windows to display system time & date and internet connection quality. Use the menu to change settings. Double click the window to go full screen.

# Known issues

 - Hard coded German language
 - Might cause memory leaks

# Good old times

First developed some time 2013. Or maybe 2014.
Wow, I'm old.
