# Neo Time Overlay

An old *Java* based application, built during my early years of Java development.
My pet project, that has many flaws, bugs and a lot of...
let's call it... *potential*.

Nevertheless, I am happy to archive it via GitHub and retrace my roots.

# How to use
Run it, and it stays on top of your other windows to display system time & date and internet connection quality.
Use the menu to change settings.
Double-click the window to go full screen.

# Known issues

# Good old times
First developed some time 2013. Or maybe 2014.
Wow, I'm old.
